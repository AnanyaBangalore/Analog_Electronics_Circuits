# Analog_Electronics_Circuits
My lab materials for analogue electronics circuits are stored in this repository. The documents contain schematics, circuit designs, and simulation data that I produced as part of my study.

The function, design, and analysis of each lab file's associated Analogue Electronics circuit are briefly described. The files are arranged according to lab sessions and include information on a variety of topics, such as oscillators, filters, and amplifiers.

In general, the lab materials offer a thorough introduction to analogue electronics and show how it may be used in real-world situations. They are appropriate for academics and amateurs who are interested in designing and analysing analogue circuits.
